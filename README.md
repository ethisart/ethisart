# ETH IS ART üé®

We all know ETH IS MONEY üí∏... But now ETH IS ART üé® as well!

ETH IS ART allows you to wrap 1 ETH into a randomly generated, fully onchain, artwork - a Non-fungible ETH. In short, you can make your Ether RARE and FANCY!

The NFeth can always be redeemed back to 1 ETH, but the artwork will in return be destroyed. Kind of like a digital piggy bank - to redeem the ETH you must break open the NFeth.

## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
